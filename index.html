   <h3>WHO AM I?</h3>

      <P>I am a Black woman, life coach, podcaster, talk show host, jewwelry designer, actress, and a mom who loves to code. <br>
     Now maybe, you might be asking yourself, "Why do I need to know all of that information?" <br>
     My answer would be, because it gives you a peek into who I am, and who I am becoming while on my coding journey.
      </P>
   

   <h3>WHAT I AM DOING RIGHT NOW</h3>
    <p>Instead of trying to teach myself coding as I have done in the past and I am currently attending the FlatIron School based in my home, New York City.</p>
    <p>I work at <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/?utm_source=gateway&utm_medium=footer">Amazon</a> as a Problem Solver, Learning Ambassador and a Fulfillment Associate on the Ship Dock.<br>
    Amazon is sponsoring my cirriculum at the <a href="https://flatironschool.com/">Flatiron School.</a></p>
