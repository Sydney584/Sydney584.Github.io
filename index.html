   <h4>Front End Web Software Developer</h4>

   
   <h3>WHO AM I?</h3>

   <P>I am a Black woman, life coach, podcaster, talk show host, jewwelry designer, actress, and a mom who loves to code. <br>
     Now maybe, you might be asking yourself, "Why do I need to know all of that information?" <br>
     My answer would be, because it gives you a peek into who I am, and who I am becoming while on my coding journey.
   </P>
   

   <h3>What I am doing Right Now?</h3>
   <p>Instead of trying to teach myself coding as I have done in the past and I am currently attending the FlatIron School based in my home, New York City.</p>
   <p>I work at Amazon as a Fulfillment Associate on the Ship Dock. At Amazon I am a Problem Solver and a Learning Ambassador. <br>
    Amazon is also sponsoring my attendance at the Flatiron School. </p>
