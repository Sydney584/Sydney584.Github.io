   <h3>WHO AM I?</h3>

      <P>I am a Black woman, life coach, podcaster, talk show host, jewwelry designer, actress, and a mom who loves to code. <br>
     Now maybe, you might be asking yourself, "Why do I need to know all of that information?" <br>
     My answer would be, because it gives you a peek into who I am, and who I am becoming while on my coding journey.</P>

   <h3>WHAT I AM DOING RIGHT NOW</h3>
    <p>Instead of trying to teach myself coding as I have done in the past and I am currently attending the FlatIron School based in my home, New York City.</p>
    <p>I work at <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/?utm_source=gateway&utm_medium=footer">Amazon</a> as a Problem Solver, Learning Ambassador and a Fulfillment Associate on the Outbound Ship Dock.<br>
    Amazon is sponsoring my cirriculum at the <a href="https://flatironschool.com/">Flatiron School.</a></p>

   <h3>How and Why I got into Tech</h3>
   <p>My story started a long time ago. In my first blog post about my tech journey called <a href="https://sydneychase5841.medium.com/woulda-coulda-shoulda-15d32435c42a">"Woulda, Coulda, Shoulda?",</a> I begin to map out where I was and where I am today. </p>
   <p>Tech is intergrated in our daily lives, coding is implemented in almost everything we do. <br>
    I have found that I need to upskill and learn new programming languages so I can create some of the applications I see in my mind.
