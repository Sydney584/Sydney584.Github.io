   <h2>A BIT ABOUT ME</h2>

   <P>I am a Black woman, life coach, podcaster, talk show host, jewwelry designer, actress, and mom who loves to code. <br>
     Now maybe, you might be asking yourself, "Why do I need to know all of that information?" <br>
     My answer would be, because it makes up who I am and encompasses who I am also becoming. 
   </P>
   <p>Instead of teaching myself coding as I have done in the past and attempted to do in the present I am currently attending the FlatIron School</p>

   <P>What I am doing Right Now</P>

   <p>How I got into Tech</p>

   <p>Education</p>

   <p>Programs I am learning and interested in learning</p>
